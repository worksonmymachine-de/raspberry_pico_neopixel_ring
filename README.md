# raspberry_pico_neopixel_ring
A NeoPixel ring with 8 RGB LEDs and two buttons on a Raspberry Pico with CircuitPython

Adjustable in color and brightness this setup will most probably be moved from the breadboard to a casing and provide some ambient light behind the monitor :)

With one button you can cycle through a preset of colors. With the other button you can cycle through the brigthness with predefined step. Holding the button does the same in an interval.
Pressing both buttons turns off the light (brightness to 0) and pressing any button after that turns it on again with the same color and brightness as before.

When stopping the script the LEDs will turn off, too.

Have fun!
